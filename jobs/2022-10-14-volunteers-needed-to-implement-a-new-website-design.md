Peninsula Environmental are looking for a volunteer web developer to implement a new design which has already been created. We are a micro business within the sustainability consultancy industry based in Scotland and we have started to trade recently. 
The platform has yet to be agreed possibly Squarespace or Webflow? but we personally do not care as long as it should be optimised for SEO, CRM system: (hubspot?) and e-mail, and linkedin. The main goal of the website is to attract traffic and be a source or warm leads. The platform determines the language but we expect  the volunteer to be knowledgeable on a mix of Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project might be of relevance to someone who is taking the first steps in their career and would like to add this experience to their own portfolio. References will be provided.
